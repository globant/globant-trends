              <p>
                In the past, and even to some extent today, there have been misconceptions about design. <br/>
                We sometimes think of design as the result of an aesthetic process, just the embellishment of a product, or some visual reaction to something, and that’s partly true, but there’s much more to it.
              </p>

              <p>
                When we at the Globant Creative Studio create a product, it’s an iterative process where we look at user behavior, analyzing the way they use the product and the way they feel about the product so that we really understand the context, then design with that knowledge and insight.
                <br/>
                It’s a different way of working, one where design is an integrated part of the product strategy, rather than being just an afterthought in the process of product development, adding some color or decoration here and there. When you do it that way you find your mistakes afterward. Our strategy lets us think ahead and create really innovative products that always have the user in mind.
              </p>

              <img src="img/responsive-image.jpg" alt="example responsive design">
            </a>

            <div class="clear"></div>

            <div class="panel panel-callout left">
              It’s important to understand that design is not only a visual response but also something that aligns with business, technology and the way we live and interact with each other.
            </div>

            <p class="panel right">

              I want businesses to understand the huge potential of strategic design to create really innovative, user-friendly products,
              and we’re working to change design misconceptions by integrating user experience and user behavior into our design strategy.

              <br/> <br/>

              I think there’s some major innovation underway in experience design across a wide spectrum of industries it’s very clear that
              the entertainment industry is one of the easiest industries to implement this concept. It’s an industry where creativity and
              innovation have always been highly valued. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the financial industry, which is one we
              don’t always think of as being really creative, but where we’re seeing amazing results

              <br/> <br/>

              The past few years I’ve seen the financial industry realizing the value of really understanding consumer behavior in order to provided quality service, so I’ve seen a lot of effort and innovation in that industry as well.
